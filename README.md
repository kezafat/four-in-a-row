# Team fivesies four in a rowsies
Our collaborative effort as a team. We're reverting the good ol' game of for-in-a-row from a thing of the past back to a thing of the present again!
Play against a friend and see who has to buy who lunch.


This project makes use of two super duper _nifty_ tools:
#json-flex | Get it @Â https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonflex
Short description: "A JSON stringifier and parser than handles and restores circular references and as well as class instances."
Credit and big thanks go to the author: Thomas Frank | https://github.com/ironboy 

#sass-autocompiler (A beautiful addon to the node-sass package)
Short description: "A superneat autocompiler that compiles on startup (optional) and on filechanges. Blazing fast and super convenient!"
Credit and big thanks go to the author: Dennis Majvall | Github unknown (please add if you know it)

Clone, npm-install and go nuts!
