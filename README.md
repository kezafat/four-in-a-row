#Our development branch.
Features are branched off THIS branch (dev) and merged back into THIS branch when tested and done.

#Major releases (1 for each sprint) will be merged onto Master from Dev.
- No commits are to be made on Master.
- No merges into master unless it is a final version (e.g v.1)

#Let's keep things nice and tidy folks, nice and tidy...
